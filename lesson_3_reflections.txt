When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  To share my work and collaborate with othe team members.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    There might be changes that are not reay to be published. So it is better to
    have control over what is sharedin GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks: is like a clone that we do unsing GitHub website and it is saved only in
	the website. It saves the origin whre we did the fork.

	Clones: are copies of all the files from a project. They can be done from GitHub
	to a local computer or in the local computer itself.

	Branches: are division of the project that we do to experiment with some chanches before
	adding those chnges to teh master branch. They can be also used to work on differntets parts
	of a project at the same time.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
